# Calculator Web App [APP](https://calculator-demo-35a6b599d4cd.herokuapp.com/)

A simple web-based calculator built with Django, deployed on Heroku. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It also supports power operations (`x10^x`).

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Exponentiation: `x10^x` (multiplies by 10 raised to the power of `x`).
- Clear screen functionality (`C`).
- Delete last input (`DEL`).
- Responsive design and mobile-friendly layout.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (on Heroku)
- **Deployment**: Heroku

## Installation
